there is a global variable errno which is availabel to all the process and it holds the error no of the last sys call
you have to include <errno.h> header file
default value is 0
here errors are runtime errors
and all the things related to syscall are stored in the URAEA

lseek can only be used in "regular" file

windows have a "pagefile.sys" is a swap partition which is approx 3 to 4 gb generally page file is of 25% of our RAM and it is a "whole in the file" and the .sys files are system files and pagefile.sys is used for swap in and swap out if the space in RAM is full

in todays os it gives by default 4kb but it is virtual practically it gives only 1kb to write and after that 1kb then it gives another 1kb to write
